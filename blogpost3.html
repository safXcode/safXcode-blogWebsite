        <p class="font1">How does one even begin to think about web development? With the sheer volume of information
            out there, it’s no wonder that so many people find it difficult to get started in this industry. However,
            there are some crucial factors and techniques that you need to take into account if you want your site to
            succeed in this very competitive market! In this article, we’ll explore some of the essential dos and don’ts
            when it comes to web development that you should definitely consider before you even sit down at your
            computer!</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">First things first</h2>
        <p class="font1">search engine optimization is one of those terms that has a lot of definitions—and even more
            misconceptions. Most people think of SEO as an event, like a website launch, where SEO experts swoop in to
            throw their weight around. In reality, SEO starts way before any website opens its doors for business—it’s
            all about web development. </p>

        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Start with a keyword strategy</h2>
        <p class="font1">Start by figuring out what keywords people are using to search for your business (as well as
            your competitors’). To do that, conduct some keyword research. Use tools like Google AdWords Keyword Planner
            to discover how many people are searching for those terms every month, learn how competitive it is, and
            identify related terms that might be easier to rank for. With a good keyword strategy in place, you can then
            get started on actually creating content.</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Develop content</h2>
        <p class="font1">Search engines look for keywords in text. To be found, your site should deliver content
            relevant to users' search queries. If you're building a website for your business, make sure you have a
            strategy for getting users to it—and keep them coming back. For example, if you sell surfboards online,
            think about including tips on surfing or relevant articles from magazines and online publications (that
            includes links back to your site). Your web development can increase traffic by 50% if done correctly.
            Search engines love sites that engage their users with new content regularly so think beyond just
            advertising your brand; be creative about what readers might find interesting about your business or
            industry. Remember that keyword use isn't always obvious: don't neglect titles or links to internal pages
            that may appear in search results!</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Link your site to authority sites</h2>
        <p class="font1">Linking your site to authority sites is one of the best ways to boost search engine ranking.
            It’s also a valuable way to increase referral traffic, drive sales and build relationships with influencers
            who might later spread word about your brand. Authority sites are online properties that have a strong
            domain reputation, strong link profile and often employ an active social media presence. To find authority
            sites in your niche, do some research on SimilarWeb , SEMRush or Ahrefs . Once you've found some, reach out
            to them via email or social media (if possible) to inquire about adding a link back to your site.</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Focus on quality over quantity</h2>
        <p class="font1">Anyone can write an optimized post that ranks high in search results. Unfortunately, when
            people try to optimize their content too aggressively they end up doing things that are prohibited by
            Google. So while it’s a good idea to focus on writing quality content that is highly relevant to your
            audience, you don’t want to do so at any cost. Instead, invest some time into studying what Google finds
            objectionable—and then avoid doing those things when creating your posts. For example, if Google won’t like
            it if you publish duplicate or similar content on multiple sites in an attempt to increase page rank
            (indexing), then don’t do it—even if it means publishing less content overall!</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Use internal links within your blog</h2>
        <p class="font1">Internal links are important because they keep your users on your site longer. Longer visits =
            higher search rankings, as Google looks at how many quality pages you have per session, as well as how long
            users stay on each page. After all, if you’re bouncing around from page to page or leaving quickly (t/f?),
            it might be a sign that your content isn’t particularly engaging.</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Social media sites play an important role in search engine optimization</h2>
        <p class="font1">they give you a way to let your potential customers know that you’re out there. That said,
            social media sites can also work against you if they’re not used correctly—if you play fast and loose with
            Facebook rules or Twitter etiquette, your social media presence can actually get flagged by Google. Here are
            some dos and don’ts for using social media sites effectively in order to help boost your web development
            business</p>
