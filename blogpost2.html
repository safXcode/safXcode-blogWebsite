        <p class="font1">It can be difficult to find time in your busy schedule to dedicate to practicing healthy
            habits. This makes it all the more important that you do find time to practice these habits, even if only
            for five minutes at a time. These five healthy habits will only take five minutes of your day, but they can
            greatly improve your health and overall wellness—and you’ll start seeing benefits from them as soon as you
            start practicing them.</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Stretching</h2>
        <p class="font1">Adding just five minutes of stretching to your morning routine is an easy way to become more
            flexible and limber. Stretch by getting into a lunge position with one leg bent in front of you and one leg
            extended behind you, pushing each foot toward your opposite knee. Hold that position for five seconds then
            switch legs and repeat. Repeat four times on each side. After stretching, walk around or do some light
            exercise such as jogging in place before starting your day. Avoid activities like running up stairs or
            jumping rope too soon after stretching – doing so can cause injuries if muscles are not warmed up first.</p>

        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Breathing Exercise</h2>
        <p class="font1">Deep breathing, or pranayama, involves breathing in and out through your nose. Deep breaths
            push oxygen into your lungs and remove carbon dioxide from your blood stream, helping you to relax and feel
            calm. For a short breath-work session, sit up straight in a comfortable chair with both feet on the floor.
            Close your eyes. Breathe deeply—through your nose only—in for four seconds and out for six seconds. Repeat
            five times, until you feel relaxed. If it helps, have a pen and paper handy; writing down any thoughts that
            come up can help clear them from your mind so they don’t distract you. Try not to lose track of time; if
            your phone is nearby, set an alarm so you know when five minutes are up.</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Change Your Environment</h2>
        <p class="font1">Did you know your environment can influence how long you’re able to stick with a habit? If
            you’re trying to increase your fitness, change one thing about your environment for five minutes a day. For
            example, if you want to work out in front of your TV but don’t usually have time, turn off your computer and
            phone and make sure no one else is in your home. A study from University College London found that
            fitness-related habits will stick best when people remove all temptation or barriers in their way. A clean
            slate is key—so think small and limit yourself to just five minutes!</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Drink More Water</h2>
        <p class="font1">Many people don’t get enough water in their diet, especially if they’re not used to consuming
            it regularly. The human body needs between two and four liters of water per day for optimal performance, so
            staying well hydrated is an essential habit for your overall health. There are many ways to drink more
            water: installing a wall-mounted water dispenser, bringing a reusable bottle with you everywhere you go, or
            simply carrying a glass around as you move throughout your home. Make it a point to drink at least one glass
            per hour today. If that seems like too much, start by making sure you drink at least eight ounces before
            breakfast, lunch and dinner each day.</p>


        <h2 class="blogPostHeading">Meditate</h2>
        <p class="font1">Most people think meditation is something that takes you away from reality—that it’s a form of
            escapism. Not so. Done right, it actually makes you more aware of what’s going on around you and more in
            tune with your body and mind. And as an added bonus, it relieves stress and gives you a better outlook on
            life. Anyone can do it. It doesn’t require any special equipment or clothing. All you need to meditate is
            five minutes (yes, I said five minutes), a quiet place, and yourself.</p>
